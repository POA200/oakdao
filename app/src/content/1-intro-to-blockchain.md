# Introduction to Blockchain

Blockchain is a shared, append-only ledger maintained by a network of computers. Instead of relying on a single database, every participant keeps a synchronized copy.

## Key ideas

- Blocks: Batches of transactions linked together with cryptographic hashes.
- Decentralization: No single party controls the ledger; consensus ensures agreement.
- Immutability: Once recorded, data is economically expensive to alter.
- Transparency: State and history are verifiable by anyone with access to the chain.

## Why it matters

Blockchains enable trust-minimized coordination. They power use cases like cryptocurrencies, NFTs, DeFi, and identity—without requiring a central authority.

> TL;DR: A blockchain is a tamper-evident, decentralized ledger for recording and verifying state changes.
